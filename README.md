Pull that app down 
```
https://github.com/LaunchAcademy/engage-boilerplate
cd engage-boilerplate
```
Remove git (so that you can add your own)
```
rm -rf .git
```
then re-add git so that you can add to your own repo
```
git init
```
And then you are ready to go! Feel free to change the name of the folder to the name of your app
